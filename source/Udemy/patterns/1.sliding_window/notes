Multiple Pointers:

-only works with a sorted array;
-have to be moving forward, backward, or to the middle. You can't alternate between the depthFirstRecursive


Sliding Window:
-Array doesn't have to be sorted.
-for keeping track of a continous subset of data in an array/string.
-Also a form of multiple pointers, because you have a starting and ending window, either stated explicitly like in our findLongestSubstring and minSubArray functions or implicitly like in our maxSubArraySum functions.
