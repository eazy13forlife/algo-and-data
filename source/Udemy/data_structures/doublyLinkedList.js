But, we don't want this.tail to have a next property and equal the same thing as this.head. this.tail should just equal the new newNode that we created, so we set this.tail to a completely new object in reference by doing this.tail=newNode. Also, since we are working with a doubly linked list, when we do this.tail.next=newNode, we have to make sure to set the previous value on the new newNode to be what came before, and this is going to be this.tail, because if there is more than one item in our list, since this.tail equals the very last newNode that we added to out list(meanwhile, this.head equals the very first newNode that we added to our list), its next property when our else clause runs will be the new newNode that we created, so we want this new newNode that we created to have a previous of the last newNode created in our list which is this.tail.
